# readme-generator

# Description

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

The project was built to help developers generate a high-quality README file for their project with minimal effort. Creating a README file can be time-consuming and many developers may not have the time or the writing skills to create a professional-looking document. By building a tool that automates the process of generating a README file, developers can save time and focus more on the actual development of their project.

A well-written README file is important for any project, as it provides users with information about the project, including its purpose, features, installation instructions, and usage. However, creating a README file from scratch can be time-consuming and difficult, especially for developers who are not experienced in technical writing. The README generator solves this problem by providing an easy-to-use tool that automates the process of creating a professional-looking README file.

Through building this project, I learned how to use the npm inquirer package to create interactive command-line interfaces, as well as how to write and read files in Node.js. Additionally, I learned about the value of creating reusable code and modularizing my project into smaller, more manageable components.

# Installation

To generate your own README, git clone the repo down to your local mashine so you have the Node project on your local.

Run npm install in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the package.json.

inquirer will prompt you for your inputs from the command line.

# Usage

The application will start by running node index.js in the command line.
